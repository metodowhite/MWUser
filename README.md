### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like AFNetworking in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/wiki/Getting-Started-with-AFNetworking).
